# Module 3 Challenge - Bitcoin Exchange Aribtrage Analysis
Module 3 Challenge Repository 

We wanted to to analyze bitcoin closing prices across two different Bitcoin trading platforms to understand if any arbitrage opportunities existed. The 2 exhanges we analyzed are coinbase and bitstamp. We utilized data from January 1st, 2018 to March 31st, 2018 from both exchanges.  If an arbitrage situation presented itself, we wanted to see if we could capitalize on making profitable trades that took into consideration our 1% trading.  Additionally, if we could make profitable trades, how much would our average trade make that day and the cumulative profits for each day.
